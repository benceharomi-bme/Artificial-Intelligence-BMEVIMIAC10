# The Python solution
## Starting the program
Run the program with the following command:
```
python3 pallet-loading.py
```

If you would like to load the input from the `input.txt` then simply add the `FILE` argument:

*Please mind that the `input.txt` should be in the root of the `python` directory*
```
python3 pallet-loading.py FILE
```
